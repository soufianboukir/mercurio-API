## ðŸ”„ Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork** this repository (top-right corner on GitHub).  
2. **Clone** your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soufianboukir/zyncui.git
   cd zyncUI
   ```
3. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b feat/my-feature
   ```
4. Make your changes (code, docs, or fixes).

5. Commit and push to your fork:
   ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "describe your changes"
    git push origin feat/my-feature
   ```
   
7. Open a Pull Request (PR) from your fork â†’ main branch of this repo.



This is **all-in-one**: it explains the fork/branch/PR workflow and includes a minimal PR checklist.  

If you want, I can also **add a tiny section about component structure** so contributors know where to put new components and docs â€” still keeping it super simple. Do you want me to do that?
